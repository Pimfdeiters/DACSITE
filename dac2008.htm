Report of the 11th Annual DAC gathering, Pontresina, August 6th – 9th<br>
<br>

<br>
Writing a report on the DAC gathering is a bit like getting ready for a reunion 
after an <br>
expedition. You search for the pictures and notes you took, for memorabilia, for 
tokens <br>
that can evoke the atmosphere that made the event special. Such a post-event 
reunion <br>
usually takes place at a different location, and in a different season, than the 
event itself. <br>
And so, this report is written in New England, on a beautiful, crisp October Day. 
Sweater <br>
weather. Maple trees flaming red; scatterings of the first fallen leaves. On the 
lawn of the <br>
Jesse Lee Memorial Church, over a thousand pumpkins are lined up for sales: 
Halloween <br>
is looming. It is time, therefore, to write my report before new events begin to
<br>
overshadow the still vivid memories of this summer. <br>

<br>
My own pictures, and those on that great CD from Rene I just received, help 
bring it all <br>
back. But, for me, the carrot-funeral picture from Liekje epitomizes it <br>
even more. It “takes the cake,” so to speak. -- a carrot-cake; my <br>
favorite --. With her permission, here it is. This hapless vegetable <br>
caused the members of the DAC to stir. Our silver-tongued tour-leader <br>
Jan, even when his head-gear was blinking red, couldn’t command <br>
such attention with his witty announcements. But anyone clenching the <br>
carrot could mesmerize the agitated clan-members. Like a scepter in <br>
the hand of a monarch, it became a symbol of power, inspiring awe <br>
and fear. So much so, that the only way to overcome its totemic sway <br>
was to turn it into its own opposite, And so it became an object of fear <br>
and loathing, aversion and disgust. A typical example of how a clan <br>
deals with internal or external threats. <br>

<br>
On Friday, on Opening Night of the DAC Special
Olympics, “it” was carried into the Stadium in <br>
triumph by that sports-fan from The Hague, Jan Wulf.
There it met with instant reverence. <br>
The next day,
however, it was a mere relic, a shade of its former
self. <br>
It lost its firmness, became limp and, during the </p>
<p><img border="0" src="Alle foto's/DAC 2008/DAC 2008 foto 3.jpg" width="572" height="307"><br>
<br>
“uitloopborrel” at Hein and Connie’s, it was slipped around like a bad penny. 
Let this be <br>
a lesson for the entire clan: “Popularity (like the window of opportunity) has 
but a limited <br>
lifetime.” It is not surprising that Liekje, who gave proof of her talent for 
grasping the <br>
totality, the dynastic dimension, of the clan by calling forth the memory of 
those who <br>
have passed, saw to it that the ambiguity surrounding the carrot, “de pijn om de 
peen,” <br>
was, at last, put to rest along with the limp tuber itself. <br>
<br>
“What has this got to do with the DAC,” you may ask, “with hiking, golfing, 
eating and <br>
drinking? When is that “report of yours about to begin?” Well, you are already 
deeply <br>
into it. That carrot symbolized the mercurial spirit of the DAC. Who cares, 
really, what <br>
exactly we did? Whether it rained or shone? Whether the wine from staak Paul was 
better <br>
than that from staak Ben? (Irrelevant question anyway; the best wine was from 
the <br>
combined stakes Frits and Hein, of course). Who cares whether it took five or 
ten hours <br>
to get somewhere; who slept next to, or with, whom? (Thanks Connie and Jan, for
<br>
providing Ann and me with reasonably private accommodations. It has been well 
over <br>
forty years since I slept this close to Nic.) <br>
<br>

<br>
And what about the golf tournament? Ann and I
arrived at the “in-loop borrel,” the least taxing <br>
part of that day. The awards ceremony in “het
fusielokaal” of the Pontresina residence of <br>
Patries and Jan (and Paul Hz) was conducted by
veteran Frank who, standing on a cooler, <br>
maintained a modicum of decorum while the
clan began to warm up to each other and to its <br>
capacity for partying which was given a huge
infusion by the late entry of the three glamorous <br>
ladies of staak Paul and their escort/manager/booking-agent, Wulf. No doubt, the 
prize <br>
winners all deserved what they got, but what I remember is that Pia won first 
prize. Did <br>
you get cash, Pie, or one of those things that end up a trophy in your 
guest-plee, in plain <br>
view of the captive audience of envious friends and folks? <br>
<br>
Of course we hiked, had painful confrontations with our limited, even 
diminishing, <br>
capacities, suffered injuries. But nothing that Dokter Nic could not handle. (How 
are your <br>
feet today, Floris?) We saw “het eude landschap” (yes I know, “o:de,” but I have 
no <br>
horizontal umlauts here) of lower Engadin and some of us made an attempt to 
summit Piz <br>
Quattervals, the highest one around. Our two guides, one of whom looked like he 
could <br>
have posed for Van Gogh’s “Potato Eaters,” were leading their party consisting 
of Paul, <br>
Thijs and me, up into an increasingly steeper dead-end alley, a cascade of 
pebbles, <br>
billions of them. Not since Mt Semeru in East-Java did I see so much scree. The 
rest of <br>
the clan also had a tough hike, I was told. Who told me? Kees and Nic did. They
<br>
scrambled onto our bus at a local stop up the Ofenpas. We were all on our way to 
the <br>
comforts of the Hotel Berghaus, or the DAC Olympic Arena. <br>
<br>
The previous two nights, Wednesday and Thursday, been used to get re-oriented 
within <br>
the “staak” (we, staak Hein, ate at the Pizza-place) and within “the clan” (rubbing
<br>
<br>
shoulders among all four stakes in the ever cozy, time-trusted, Cluozza Hut that 
has seen <br>
a good number of DAC members) in order to determine one’s place; to seek the 
comfort <br>
levels experienced in previous gatherings; to relish in the 
“seeing-you-again-after-so-<br>
long.” Then came Friday night, when risks were taken and creativity and emotions 
began <br>
to flow like the wine of that night (staak Ben’s, I believe). The night when new 
clowns <br>
manifested, new voices were heard, including speeches by members of the younger
<br>
generation and the out-laws. The night, also, when serious notes, in particular 
by Liekje <br>
and Els, were heard and appreciated. The night, when groom Andrew kissed bride 
Leah <br>
to loud cheers from the entire clan. <br>
<br>
It is also the night of the glorious entry of our Olympic, all-female team, with 
its afore-<br>
mentioned, leather-hosen-clad, manager Wulf. While one member of staak Paul, 
Michele, <br>
was dressed for heavy weather, her younger sister, Gertie, literally bared 
herself, ready to <br>
dive in. It was, to borrow a phrase, (and to close this up), “a night to 
remember.” <br>
<br>
By asking me to write this report (mindful of the adage, “Be careful what you 
pray for, <br>
God may answer your prayers”) you are getting the 11th DAC only as one person
<br>
remembers it. And what I remember in addition to the great group-fun we had, are 
the <br>
individual contacts. In our group of about 40 members there are roughly (40 x 
39) / 2 = <br>
780 contacts between two individuals. I can only account for 39 of these. And,
<br>
understandably, some were of greater intensity than most others. When we 
communicate <br>
afterwards, don’t we often feel the need to say: “I didn’t get, or take, as much 
time to talk <br>
with you as I would have liked, but DIDN”T WE HAVE FUN?!” <br>
<br>
That, at least, is what I came away with. Many thanks, once
more, to all who made this great event happen, <br>
and by that I
mean: YOU ALL. And a very special word of thanks is to go
to Connie and Jan, <br>
who organized it all, and to the hosts of the
borrels: Jan &amp; Patries, and Hein &amp; Connie. It was great that <br>
Ben and Marianne had taken the trip to be there, with Helene
and Teun as their support team. <br>
One of my best memories is
actually a post-DAC one: On Sunday morning, (the “morning-after” <br>
the “closing ceremonies” that had brought out more
talents, feelings and roaring laughter), Marianne,<br>
Ben, Paul
Ann and I took a walk in the Rosegtal and later had lunch at
the same place where we <br>
had dined the night before, The
Station Restaurant. Here we are, on the left. <br>
<br>

<br>
And finally, you may recall that I did some limericks on various groups, 
covering all <br>
members at least once. Here they are, in the order in which they were presented:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Staak Paul: Liekje, Michele &amp; Wulf and Gertie: <br>
Wulf sloeg er EEN aan de haak. <br>
Nu heeft hij de prettige taak, <br>
Te begeleiden <br>
Drie wilde meiden: <br>
De dames van Paul z’n staak. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="Alle foto's/DAC 2008/DAC 2008 foto 6.jpg" width="260" height="150"><br>
<br>
Geblesseerden: <br>
Pijn aan je teen? Ben je ziek? <br>
Ga dan even naar Dokter Niek. <br>
Zijn “bag-of-tricks” <br>
Die krijg je voor niks. <br>
Heus, het kost je geen ene piek. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="Alle foto's/DAC 2008/DAC 2008 foto 7.jpg" width="187" height="147"><br>
<br>
Staak Frits: Valerie &amp; Nic, Margriet &amp; Rene, Karin, Robert Jan &amp; Annemarie, 
Floris: <br>
Wanneer de condities zijn bits, <br>
Neem een voorbeeld aan de staak Frits: <br>
Drie “very smart ladies” <br>
En ‘n zwager die’s medisch, <br>
En RJ en gezin: alles kits. <br>
<br>
<br>
Staak Ben: Els (&amp; zieke Louck), Frank &amp; Rita, Pieter &amp; Mariette, Hein &amp; Connie, 
Andrew &amp; Leah: <br>
De clown van staak Ben, dat is Hein. <br>
Goh, wat maakt die gozer een gein. <br>
In sigaretten begon-ie; <br>
Met behulp van Connie <br>
Runt hij een slot, met veel wijn. <br>
<br>
<br>
Outlaws aka Kouwe Kant: Nic, Rene, Annemarie, Rita, Mariette, Connie, Ann, <br>
Teun, Marianne, Kees, Patricia D-R, Wulf <br>
Heel wat zijn er protestant, <br>
Maar werden je rechterhand. <br>
Al zijn ze wat ronder, <br>
We kunnen niet zonder: <br>
U raadt het, de Kouwe Kant. <br>
<br>
<br>
The young couple (Andrew and Leah) <br>
This DAC couldn’t come any sooner <br>
For Andrew, the honeymooner <br>
And his beautiful bride, <br>
Leah by his side. <br>
Andrew, this is the moment to swoon her! <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="Alle foto's/DAC 2008/DAC 2008 foto 8.jpg" width="157" height="263"><br>
<br>
The younger generation: Floris, Pia Fx, Thijs, Emo, Hein, Emilie <br>
We have all these very “Kool Kids” <br>
Sitting here in our midst. <br>
They are our assurance <br>
Of DAC’s long endurance. <br>
It is thanks to them that it lives. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="Alle foto's/DAC 2008/DAC 2008 foto 9.jpg" width="294" height="90"><br>
<br>
Staak Hein: Toon &amp; Ann, Helene &amp; Teun, Pia, Ben &amp; Marianne, Paul, Pia Faxon, <br>
Patrice &amp; Kees, Thijs, Emo, Hein, Jan &amp; Patries, Emilie. <br>
Wie drinken de meeste wijn? <br>
Van wie er de meesten zijn! <br>
En als ik goed tel <br>
(kan ik nog wel?) <br>
Dan is dat de hele staak Hein. </p>

<br>
<br>
Three Cheers for our Leaders <br>
Wie zitten hier, flank tegen flank? <br>
Wie zitten er weer aan de drank? <br>
‘T zijn Connie en Jan. <br>
Zij maakten’r wat van! <br>
Groot is dan ook onze dank! <br>
<br>

<br>
DAC 2008 <br>
Dat was het dan weer met “The DAC.” <br>
Eenieder weer terug naar zijn plek. <br>
Maar als je het even <br>
Opnieuw wil beleven <br>
Dan is deze foto niet gek: <br>
