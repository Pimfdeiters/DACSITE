<p><b>Running and climbing in Kenya, september 2006</b></p>
<hr>
<p>I don’t take as many business trips as I used to, but once in a while I 
travel to look after things. I recently traveled to Kenya where my son Erik has 
set up shop, meaning a B&amp;B and safari business and a furniture building 
operation. As I am one of his advisors and investors, I have to be available 
from time to time. So I went there in September.<br>
<br>
I traveled via Holland where I keep most of my mountaineering equipment. I 
always try to combine business with other, more nourishing pursuits, and Erik 
and I had been talking about doing Mount Kenya, at well over 5000M (16,500Ft) 
the second highest mountain (after Kilimanjaro) in Africa. I purchased a few 
articles in my favorite trekking store in The Hague, one of those sleeveless 
safari jackets, and dried food rations that would come in handy on the mountain.<br>
<br>
The B&amp;B, with the property on which it sits, is called Kitengela House and is 
situated south of Nairobi National Park and adjacent to it. There is no fence 
there (there is one on the Nairobi side) and only a steep, narrow canyon 
separates the park from the property. This means that animals can roam over and, 
from time to time, do so. There had been lions between Erik’s home and the main 
lodge only three weeks before, and one morning there was fresh evidence of 
buffalo on the long driveway. A herd of these rather unpredictable animals 
produces a lot of dung. And that makes one’s morning run more challenging.<br>
<br>
I had asked Erik if it was safe to jog. I always jog on my travels and will jog 
anywhere. Erik arranged for an escort of two staff members whom he described as 
good runners. The really good Kenyan runners all live in the US and Europe, of 
course, but these two guys were not bad. Their shoes were a bit shoddy, their 
t-shirts oversized, their legs skinny; but they flew. We ran on dirt roads, 
poorly graded and hilly. The elevation was almost 2000M, or 6600Ft. The air was 
very dry. James and Jacob liked to test my competitive spirit now and then. We 
call it speed work. My lungs and legs got a good work-out.<br>
<br>
We set out for our trip to the mountain on September 20 around noon, a four-hour 
trip in “Bruiser”, Erik’s powerful black Range Rover. I felt well acclimatized 
to the altitude and fit. We picked up our guide James on the outskirts of 
Nairobi. Erik’s trusted cook and aide, Letoya, a gentle-mannered but tough 
Samburu, went with us as well and would stay with the car while we were on the 
mountain.<br>
<br>
We stayed at Naro Moru lodge, due west of Mt. Kenya, east of the Aberdaires. The 
lodge sits on the bank of a small clear stream with fragrant trees and shrubs in 
bloom. Mt. Kenya, at a distance of almost 30 miles, is barely visible in the 
afternoon, due to clouds. But inside the lodge, there is ample evidence of its 
proximity: the lounge is completely decorated with t-shirts of groups that have 
climbed or attempted to climb the mountain; they had come from countries all 
over the world. I ran into Rein Kielstra, a Dutchmanwho looked familiar. Turned 
out we had played field hockey in Rye and had run a NYC marathon together in the 
80s. Rein told us he was in the rose-growing business. Roses are one of Kenya’s 
main export crops. They are flown daily to the big flower auction in Holland 
from where they are re-exported to their final destinations. The roses you buy 
at Balducci’s or Stop &amp; Shop may well have been grown near Mt. Kenya.<br>
<br>
We ate and slept very well, and upon rising early we ate very well again. An 
excellent breakfast buffet with omelets made to order. We were taking on fuel 
for what we had read and been told would be a tough hike and climb. At the 
turn-off for the access road to Mt. Kenya National Park we picked up James, who 
had spent the night with nearby relatives, and a tall skinny Kikuyu whom James 
introduced as Peter, our porter. I said to Erik, “this can’t go wrong. We are 
accompanied by two apostles.”<br>
<br>
Upon entering the park at an attractive gate where a fearsome looking, but 
friendly, lady in army fatigues checked our papers, we added fresh cooling water 
to slake Bruiser’s thirst and began to drive up a long winding road into the 
jungle which culminated in twenty steep switchbacks on a red-clay and - 
mercifully- fairly dry surface. At last we came to a clearing in the jungle that 
accommodates a meteo-station: the point of departure for our climb, at an 
altitude of 3000-plusM, or about 10,000Ft. We repacked our backpacks, meaning 
handing items to James and Peter, especially Peter who had come equipped with an 
expedition-sized pack that had a lot of empty space. Letoya decided to accompany 
us for the first hour, on an easy jungle trail with good footing. He left us at 
the beginning of what is described as the ”vertical bog”, an enormous slope of 
marsh-like soil and weird looking plants, all super-sized. Hardly any trees, 
although some of the plants were so big they looked like trees. The weather was 
still good but the late morning clouds were becoming visible in the 
north-western skies. We decided not to take a long break to cook lunch, but 
instead pushed through to the hut known as either Mackinder’s Camp or Teleki 
Lodge, depending on which of the two explorers of Mt. Kenya one prefers: a Scot 
and civil servant in the British Colonial Service, or an Hungarian 
count-adventurer.<br>
<br>
Before we reached camp which lies at 4200M (13,860Ft) the weather had turned 
nasty and we were lashed at by ice-cold rain and sleet that hit us at a fierce 
angle. But, after the five hour climb, we were soon inside the sturdy hut, well 
out of wind and weather, although it was still very cold. The only other person 
there was the hut-guard who had not made a fire; he had run out of wood; too 
bad, because there was a great rough-stone fireplace. So we dressed warmly, hung 
the wet stuff to drip-dry (which it didn’t). We had brought our own cooking 
stoves and the apostles began at once to prepare a late and hearty lunch. Just 
before sunset the skies cleared and we got splendid views of the mountain. Mt. 
Kenya has three summits. The first two form a double summit, at an altitude of 
over 5200M (17,160Ft). They can be reached only via difficult routes that 
require a lot of time and serious technical climbing. Given our limited 
time-frame and lack of recent experience in such difficult terrain, we wisely 
opted for the third summit, Point Lenana, the goal of most people who go up Mt. 
Kenya. It has an attitude of 4985M (16,500Ft) and does not require technical 
climbing. Still, the route we took is in partsrather “exposed.” The 
northwest-facing, snow-covered summit slope should not be taken by inexperienced 
climbers.<br>
<br>
We had another meal before slipping fully dressed (in my case with woolen 
watch-cap and mittens) into our down sleeping bags. I did not really sleep well, 
due to the low oxygen level. When we rose at 3AM it felt as a relief. The sky 
was bright with stars, most were unfamiliar: we were in the southern hemisphere, 
just below the equator. After tea and a light snack we headed out north-east, on 
the left bank of the small stream at the bottom of the Teleki valley. At the 
foot of the huge head-wall below the Lewis Glacier we crossed that stream over a 
small bridge, and began to climb a seemingly endless and fairly steep scree 
slope toward a ridge that was barely visible against the night sky. There was no 
wind, not a cloud, and the temperature was well below freezing, around 20F. We 
worked our way up at a steady pace, and were aided by our head lamps, and I by 
my trekking poles. The first red glow of dawn appeared at about 6:10AM, when we 
saw that we were just below the ridge that would culminate in Point Lenana. To 
our left and well below us was the much shrunken Lewis Glacier. At 6:40AM we 
reached a small shelter named “the Austrian Hut”. We sipped some tea, and I took 
off my pack and lodged it and my poles against some rocks. We were less than 
300M or 1000Ft below the summit but still had about a kilometer of horizontal 
distance to go. Twice we had to leave the ridge because of impassable vertical 
rock formations and go into the snow-covered NW face. The snow was frozen hard 
and crampons would have been helpful. But we did not bring them, nor did we have 
ice-axes. The edges of our high-quality climbing boots proved indispensable.<br>
<br>
We reached the summit in full sunlight a little after 7:15AM. We discovered were 
not alone. There were six people from Colorado celebrating their success. They 
had followed a far less exposed but much longer route. It was still pretty cold 
at the summit so we did not stay more than fifteen minutes. Descending 
hard-frozen snow slopes is always more dangerous than going up them, so we were 
extra careful. Within an hour we were back at the Austrian hut, collected items 
left there and proceeded to Camp Mackinder, now visible well below us. Erik 
developed a nasty altitude headache and became nauseous.<br>

<br>
We reached the camp just after 10AM and James and Peter made breakfast while 
Erik rested in the cool shade of the hut. We were visited by a small creature 
resembling a marmot, known as a hyrex. Because of its tusk-like teeth, they say 
it is related to the elephant. A bit of a stretch in my view, but hey…<br>
<br>
Erik recovered quickly and even enjoyed some breakfast. We left Mackinder at 
10:40AM and felt better as each step down brought more oxygen. We reached the 
vertical bog around 1PM, and the descent through that endless slippery slope I 
rank as one of the mostunpleasant, difficult, and messy of any I have made in my 
fifty-five years of hiking and climbing. Somewhere, I stepped in what seemed a 
bottomless mud hole and was yanked out of balance. This did something to my back 
that wasn’t good. Certainly not good in view of the upcoming NYC marathon which 
I am planning to run.<br>
<br>
We did not get rained on, and at about 3:30PM reached the meteo station where 
Letoya had prepared a lunch of beef, potatoes and greens. We got out of our 
muddy boots and outer gear and into Bruiser. An hour or so later, having paid 
and said good-bye to the apostles, we were back at the Naro Moru lodge where the 
showers were hot and the libations cold.<br>

<br>
The next morning I took a sauna and swam in the pool with a splendid view of the 
mountain. Mount Kenya had not so much been “conquered” as “proudly added” to the 
list of summits I have had the pleasure of climbing with my son.<br>
