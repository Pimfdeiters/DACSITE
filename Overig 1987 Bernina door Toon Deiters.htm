<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is pleasantly warm. Swarms of flies 
are buzzing around the still smoking dung heaps dropped by carriage horses in 
Val Fex. Butterflies and walkers are abundant. The grass has been mown and much 
of the hay has been collected. Farmsteads and vacation chalets are sitting 
peacefully together, the farming element being more in evidence. This valley has 
not (yet) been developed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You encounter no joggers here, no 
mountain-bikers; no determined faces with wet sweatbands over foreheads. Val Fex 
is bucolic. The mountains are merely backdrop; the stage itself is green, 
agrarian, lush. Humming a tune, I walk to the small inn where Ann and some of my 
sisters are working on a sun tan. Save for a mild soreness of the thighs, I feel 
great. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Yesterday, I was walking in another 
valley, descending from the Boval Hut, after having climbed Piz Bernina via the 
Bianco Grat. There had been a fright at that hut. Ann and Patricia (my sister # 
6), who had hiked up to it to welcome me back, had been scared when they heard 
that there had been an accident in “das Buch,” a potential dangerous section of 
the north-east face of the Bernina. Apparently, some rope-parties had made a 
short-cut. People had fallen into a crevasse. The guardian of the Boval Hut, 
using his powerful telescope, had seen someone in distress, waving something 
bright red. He had become quite excited, for, as was I, his own son was expected 
at the Boval Hut after having summited the Bernina via Bianco Grat. He had 
immediately signaled for help. A helicopter from Samedan airport was on the 
scene within fifteen minutes. And some time later, near the landing platform of 
the hut where the helicopter made a first-aid stop, Ann and Patricia found out 
to their great relief that I was not one the two seriously injured, rescued 
climbers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I had seen this happen as well, from the 
Fortezza Grat, that long, in-part rocky, ridge which is also the way down of the 
Piz Palu’s “three summit traverse.” We had heard a whistled distress signal. At 
“eight o’clock” (behind our left shoulder) about two kilometers away and at an 
elevation of a few hundred yards below us, my guide – a man from Berguenn called 
Hans, a top-notch climber who soloed Eiger’s North Face -- and I saw, through my 
binoculars, someone waving frantically. Hans who had already noted three black 
dots in that dangerous terrain said he was not surprised that something had gone 
wrong. The night before, in the Tschierva Hut, there had been a lively 
discussion about the shorter route through “Das Buch.”&nbsp; Hans and a few others 
had strongly advised against using that route, on account of the many crevasses 
and the unreliability of the snow bridges due to warm weather. What made the 
short-cut attractive, however, was a two-hour earlier arrival at the Boval Hut. 
Hans and I had decided to use the safer and longer descent route, via the 
“Fortezza Grat.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We had had a fast start from the 
Tschierva Hut, that early, pre-dawn hour and were the first of six rope-parties 
to exit the steep ice wall at the top part of the Tschierva Glacier at Fuorcla 
Prievlusa, the saddle between the Morteratsch and the Bernina and reach the 
ridge that would lead us to the summit, the famous, knife-edged Bianco Grat. The 
first section turned out to consist of large rock formations. The weather looked 
still pretty good, although the guide was a bit puzzled by “a remarkably strong 
wind” which greeted us as soon as we had left the lee-side of the mountain. That 
wind became stronger by the minute, turning the guide’s puzzlement into serious 
concern. When we reached the snow ridge, the real Bianco Grat, a full gale-force 
storm was blowing. The guide warned me, ”es ist jezt ausserordentlich gefaerlich” 
(it is now extraordinarily dangerous), a warning I had never heard put so 
explicitly. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He short-roped me, and like tigers, our 
bodies pressed to the snow, we crept up on all fours to give the storm as small 
a target as possible. “If I am blown to the right, you jump to the left,” he had 
said when we started. Due to the roar of the storm, communication was virtually 
impossible. After the long snow ridge followed the rock ridge to the summit. 
Here we had to proceed on a fully uncoiled rope, belaying each other. This 
final, one hour rock-climb to the summit was even more frightening. There was 
snow and ice on the rocks and the drops on all sides were almost vertical. The 
margin for error was zero. Once in a while, the heavy rope stood like a rainbow 
in the sky, propelled by the storm. We reached the summit a little over six 
hours after our departure from the Tschierva Hut and followed the ridge toward 
Piz Csercsen for some hundred yards; then began our descent, rappelling to the 
smooth floor of the relatively wind-free&nbsp; Swiss-Italian border snow field. Our 
goal was the Boval Hut, where my 15 year old son Erik was spending the week, 
taking part in a climbing course led by Pontresina mountain guides, and where I 
would be awaited by Ann and Patricia.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hans is in a hurry. He wants to reach 
the Diavolezza Hut because there is money to be made there. As we descend the 
Fortezza Grat, he proposes that we skip the Boval Hut and, instead, cross the 
Diavolezza Glacier and ascend its far bank to the large Diavolezza Hut. He 
estimates that he won’t have enough time to first hit the Boval Hut, then 
descend to the valley and catch the last cable car to Diavolezza. I remind him 
of our arrangement:&nbsp; “Meet me at the Tschierva, deliver me at the Boval.” But 
then, all of a sudden, this “commercial” disagreement becomes entirely academic, 
because we see someone waving a red object, apparently in distress. I silently 
congratulate us with last night’s decision to take the longer route. But now it 
is our duty to come to the rescue.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As we prepare to make a quick descent to 
the Morteratsch Glacier by a series of rappels in order to climb up to “Das Buch” 
and reach the crevasse into which one or two persons have disappeared, connected 
by rope to their guide, who is frantically waving a red sweater, we hear the 
sound of a helicopter, approaching fast. It passes a little below us, following 
the midline of the Morteratsch glacier, heading straight for the scene of the 
accident. We are off the hook, immensely relieved. Without further argument, 
Hans takes me to the Boval Hut. We descend the full extent of the Fortezza Grat, 
negotiate Isola Persa and cross the Morteratsch Glacier a little downstream from 
it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is at least a two hour hike from the 
point where the helicopter passed us till we arrive at the Boval Hut at ten past 
four, well over twelve hours after we had left the Tschierva Hut. I am welcomed 
warmly by Ann and Patricia, who are very happy to see me alive and well. 
Together with the guardian, we reconstruct the events of the day. Half an hour 
later, Erik appears at the hut after his rock climbing exercises. He tells us 
that, early that morning, his group had been on its way to climb the Piz Palu; 
they had to cancel that climb due to “a raging storm that would have blown us 
off the Palu summit ridge into Italy.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I spend a few more hours with Erik; the 
girls have already left for the valley. I tell him about the 50s, when I came 
here with my parents in ’52; camped with school friends in ’59, the year when my 
parents had been very worried about me. They were in Italy, in the Dolomites – 
where I was to join them soon after -- and read in a Dutch newspaper that two 
Dutchmen had fatally fallen in the Bernina area. They turned out to be the 
promising Michielsen brothers whom I had met in ‘58 at a meeting of the Royal 
Netherlands Alpine Club, where they had given a fascinating presentation. I 
explain to Erik that there are areas to which one simply must return, to find 
closure. Later, as I descend alone to the valley, to Pontresina, I notice how 
much the Morteratsch Glacier has shrunk. Had my father not observed the same, 
when we children, Guus, Monique, Helene, Pia and I, with our funny little 
back-packs, hiked with our parents to the Boval Hut in 1952?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now it’s Val Fex, the day after the 
Bianco Grat. I feel light. Patches of mountain memories are being stitched 
together into a colorful quilt. In the past, I kept diaries of mountain 
vacations. Now I feel as if I could compress all my experiences -- all those 
vacations, the hiking, pack-carrying, scrambling, and climbing; all that snow, 
sun, rock and ice – into one paragraph, or a poem perhaps. The wind gusts of 
yesterday are those of November ’76 in Nepal, when I was part of a small Dutch 
expedition. There, in Camp 2 on the Phrul-ri just after midnight, the storm 
broke the frontal guy line of our small tent, exposing Willem Jan and me to a 
beautiful but ice-cold starry firmament. Making the best of a bad situation, we 
built a sort of igloo around the tent, and cut a few feet off our least 
important rope to re-anchor the tent. Days later, during the meditative six-day 
hike back to the world of Kathmandu, we walked one morning in the company of a 
monk wearing dark-red robes. He was not the Dalai Lama, but could have easily 
passed for him, with his glasses, sandals and ready grin. This monk offered us 
fresh water from a spring whose location he knew, saying “do not forget this 
spot where we drank together.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I carry this memory somewhere inside me. 
It has become a bit blurred, in spite of – or, perhaps, because of – the many 
slide shows I have given after the Himalaya trip. But here, in Val Fex, it comes 
back to me in graphic and colorful detail. Climbing always implies hiking 
through valleys. Aristotle asked: “what is more important, action or 
contemplation?” His own answer: “contemplation.” I sometimes pose that same 
question myself; my answer, however, is less categorical. To me, more important 
is that, of which there is less. After the Bianco Grat, it is time to smell the 
hay in a valley like Val Fex; upon scaling Phrul-ri, to dwell in a warm, lush 
Nepali valley and drink water with a monk. And if you begin to itch again for 
reaching heights, for action, then you’d do well remembering that it is down 
here, in the valley, where it all begins; and ends.</span></p>
