<font size="3">Some of you have heard this story. I told it at the second night 
dinner of the DAC trip in 1999. If you weren’t overcome by the effects of&nbsp; 
either that famous twelve-hour hike or the free-flowing wine, you may even 
remember it. I believe it deserves a place in the DAC records, so any member may 
have access to it.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">I was on Lombok, one of the lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia, 
September 7 through 10, 1990 with a&nbsp; group of fifteen hikers and climbers known 
as the Java Lavas. Volcano climbing was our raison d’etre, and Indonesia has 
more of these conical protrusions than there are members of the Deiters clan. 
This time we had our sights on Gunung (Mount) Rinjani, the second highest 
volcano in the archipelago. (The highest one is Gunung Kerinci, on Sumatra; we 
had climbed that one in October 1989.) Rinjani forms the entire northern half of 
Lombok, a huge massif with a crater several kilometers in diameter.&nbsp; The point 
of departure, a dessa (village) on the northern slopes a few kilometers from the 
sea, was reached in a three hour bus ride from Mataram. The bus was not 
air-conditioned, the seats were barely covered, the roads rather bumpy, but 
what’s wrong&nbsp; with a little hardship after the luxuries of Jakarta?</font></span></p>

<font size="3">At the staging area we spread out the supplies for the 
expedition, which would involve two overnight camps: one on the way up, and the 
other, at the edge of the crater lake, on the way down. Porters had been 
arranged but were late. The afternoon dragged on to near dusk, when at last they 
showed up. Their main task was to carry water and food, and heavy camping 
equipment. Nearby were fields with crops of onions and carrots, and women 
tending them. I talked to the driver of a small pick-up truck who was waiting 
nearby to haul the women back to their village. He was an older man, his face 
testimony to a life of toil, and he spoke some dutch.&nbsp; His final words, however, 
were latin. As he sat behind the wheel and revved up the old engine, he said, to 
my utter surprise: “Ora et labora.” Lombok is a heavily-muslim island. Had he 
been an altar boy in the catholic church? He drove away with his human load 
before I could clear this up. I had no clue of the significance, let alone&nbsp; 
prophetic power, of his words. All I felt was that this would be no ordinary 
climb.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">The climb proved to be a major test for me. I had boldly elected 
to join an eager group of&nbsp; five of our&nbsp; younger members, all British, that 
wanted to skip the first camp and go straight through the night (when it is not 
just cool, but cold!) for the summit, a vertical climb of 2700 meters. This is 
far more than one ever does in the Alps in one stretch. Add to that a huge 
horizontal distance, and you have a severe endurance test, and, in my case, the 
recipe for failure. The other nine people of our group were more sensible and 
camped after dinner near a spring located by the last fields, close to the edge 
of the jungle. Only one of them would make it&nbsp; to the summit. </font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">Our small group, led by a tough Scotsman who was rumored to be a 
former commando, pushed through the moonlit night in punishing speed. The trail 
was in good shape, at times a bit steep but manageable. It seemed endless. At 4 
AM, less than two hundred meters below the crater’s edge, at an altitude of&nbsp; 
2900 meters, a tall, hunched, BP-geologist nicknamed Turtle and I decided to 
take a break. We rolled out our sleeping bags, and lodged ourselves against some 
shrubs so we would not slide downhill. Turtle slept, he said later; I did not. 
Although I had changed into dry underwear, I was cold and uncomfortable. I lay 
waiting for sunrise, which came, mercifully, at around six. Shivering, Turtle 
and I broke camp and set off to the crater’s edge above us, to the beginning of 
the summit ridge. On smaller volcanoes, reaching the edge of the crater is often 
tantamount to making the summit. Not so on Rinjani. The circumference of the 
entire crater amounts to over twenty kilometers. From the spot where our trail 
hit the rim, it would be a 700M vertical climb, over a distance of about three 
kilometers, to the summit. (Compare this to the 800M vertical climb from the 
Dent Blanche hut at 3500M to the summit at 4300M.) The terrain was dangerous. 
While the progression along the rim to the summit&nbsp; was not overly steep, just 
like the Biancograt of Piz Bernina, a fall to either side would be fatal. On the 
north side, to our left, there was the steep scree field that characterizes the 
summit cone of most volcanoes. Lots of loose stones, and no ridges to stop you. 
If you fall and gather speed it is almost impossible to arrest yourself.&nbsp; On the 
south side was the gaping abyss, a drop of about a kilometer at the spot where 
we joined the ridge and of 1700M at the summit,&nbsp; to the bottom of the crater. 
The sun, the magnificent view and the effort soon made me forget the chills of 
the night. It was a brilliant day, and Turtle and I were making slow but steady 
progress.&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">We had been going for a couple of hours when I needed badly to&nbsp; 
take a rest. Although I didn’t feel thirsty,&nbsp; I forced myself to drink. I knew 
of the dangers of dehydration and exhaustion, and vaguely realized I might not 
have been drinking enough or replaced the salt I had lost sweating. I sat down 
in the lea of a huge boulder, while Turtle continued. To the west I could see 
Gunung Agung on Bali, and to the east Mt. Tambora on Sumbawa. Then I became 
overwhelmed by fatigue and fell into an uneasy sleep. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">I was awakened by two friends on their way down from the summit. 
They told me I was about 200M vertical climb below the summit, at a distance of&nbsp; 
less than a kilometer, and encouraged me to give it a try. They went on down, 
direction crater lake, where camp two would be ready. I tried to get up but my 
legs were not cooperating. I slept some more. After some time a group of 
Indonesian pilgrims came struggling by, some wearing sandals. Three men pulling 
(by rolled up kain, or cloth) and pushing (hands to rear-end) an older woman. We 
had passed this group on our way up, it was their third day on the mountain. 
Step by slow step they worked their way up to pray for good crops, health and 
fortune. Half an hour later I was pleased to see the first, and only, member of&nbsp; 
the group that had camped below.&nbsp; It was my friend Ilham. A Turk with a British 
passport, Ilham is short, gentle and polite to a fault. He is also tough and 
determined. He and I discussed the merits of my going up with him. Overcoming my 
lethargy, I struggled for perhaps a&nbsp; hundred meters but in vain. I felt that the 
summit was not in the cards. My weakened will said yes, my body just said no. I 
had the strange sensation that forces bigger than I were deciding things for me. 
I returned to my rock.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">Eventually I got back on my feet, but it was too late to go for 
the summit. I went down with the next two summiters of the front group, with 
Ilham and Turtle following behind. We joined the rest of the pack near the spot 
where Turtle and I had come to the rim. From there we had a spectacular view of 
the crater whose bottom was largely covered by a bluish lake, with steeply below 
us, one kilometer down, the small beach where we were to camp that night. It was 
still a difficult descent over a steep and sometimes slippery trail. The swim, 
food, beer and comfort at the lower altitude, all combined to make it an 
enjoyable camp. I forgave myself for not having made the summit: only twice 
before did I have to forego a summit while on my way, the Nadelhorn in 1962 and 
the Monte Rosa in 1963; both because of bad weather. Such excuse did not apply 
this time. I quietly made up my mind to come back one day and finish the job.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">Back in Jakarta a few days later, I had a call from Ann who was 
in Washington then. She asked: “have you heard that Oom Ben died?”&nbsp; I hadn’t, 
and decided to call Els to offer my condolences.&nbsp; In our conversation I 
recounted my strange experience on the mountain, my complete exhaustion. We 
calculated that Oom Ben had died&nbsp; around the time of my reaching camp 2.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">A few weeks later we received in the mail the death-announcement, 
featuring Oom Ben’s portrait on the outside. When I looked within, to read the 
actual announcement, it jumped right at me. His motto, “Ora et Labora”. The very 
same, last words of the old truck driver. I resolved that not only&nbsp; would I go 
back to Rinjani, I would climb it in honor of, in memoriam,&nbsp; Oom Ben.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">I got my chance in the month of August, 1994. In April of that 
year, Ann and I had been hiking up Gunung Gede, that magnificent volcano in the 
Puncak, between Jakarta, Sukabumi and Bandung. We were with a group of young 
Dutch enthusiasts, who had been brought together by Marc, the field captain of 
our hockey team, Kombinasi. Marc had served with the Dutch Marines, and loved 
exploring his new home, Indonesia. He had done rafting, scubadiving and other 
exciting things but he had never been up a mountain. His only experience with 
hilly terrain had been the knolls he had to crawl up as a Marine. He asked me to 
help him organize a weekend of hiking and rafting. He would arrange the rafting 
part while I would lead the climb. I gladly agreed. </font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">The traverse of Mt Gede (2970M), climbing up from the Puncak on 
the north-east side and descending into Sukabumi on the south slope, was a first 
volcano climb for most of the participants. The summit was reached in bright 
sunlight, but the descent&nbsp; had to be done in a torrential downpour, which turned 
the trails into small rivers. We were soaked, muddy and full of leeches by the 
time we got to the first dessa near Sukabumi,&nbsp; fourteen hours after we had 
departed from the Puncak. We spent the night in luxury at Pelabuan Ratu, on the 
Indian Ocean, gorging on grilled lobster and beer, and resting up for the next 
leg of this expedition, a white-water rafting trip down one of the fast flowing 
rivers through the jungle to the coastal plain around Pelabuan Ratu.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">The weekend was, by all accounts, a great success. There were 
calls for a repeat, but this time something really big, involving camping. I 
proposed Rinjani. That is why, a few months later, Ann and I found ourselves on 
Senggigi beach, outside Mataram on the west coast of Lombok, staring at the 
fading contours of Gunung Agung on Bali. We had a quiet evening: the other 
participants, five young Dutch couples averaging 32 years in age would arrive 
the next day. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">That evening I heard some alarming rumors. Six weeks earlier the 
people in Mataram had been hearing the sound of distant artillery, loud 
explosive sounds. It appeared that&nbsp; Mt Rinjani had erupted in a major way, and 
had been declared off limits. Huge plumes of&nbsp; spewed ash had been visible, and 
we heard that a layer of heavy, poisonous gas was hanging over the crater lake 
with nowhere to go.&nbsp; I was also told that the mountain had been quiet for more 
than a month now. An important decision lay ahead. I wanted to discuss the 
situation with Mark but had already made up my mind: we would go ahead anyway, 
and see how far we could go.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">The group arrived the next day. We frolicked near the pool, 
rested, bought last minute supplies, checked our gear. I arranged transportation 
for departure the following morning. What we didn’t need we could leave in 
storage at the hotel. At dinner -- nasi goreng and beer -- I brought up the 
matter of the recent eruptions. Nobody had qualms. We all agreed to go ahead.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">The bus trip to the dessa&nbsp; was uneventful. But once there, it 
would be a few hours before we could get going. From the Kepala Dessa (Village 
Chief) I hired twenty able-bodied men as porters, but they were not all 
immediately available. Then I had to meet with the Chief of Police. He told me 
that he would give us a permit to go up to a flat shoulder a bit below the point 
where Turtle and I had spent a few hours resting, but absolutely no further. And 
in no event were we to descend into the crater to the lake. I promised. And 
soon, with well over three hours of daylight ahead of us, we were on our way.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">My plan was simple. We would only succeed if we took our time. So 
three camps were planned. Our first camp, roughly at the same place where nine 
of our group had camped four years before, would be reached before dusk. Tents 
would be pitched,&nbsp; a fire made and plenty of water be available from a nearby 
spring. Meals were quickly cooked by adding water to dried supermie or 
nasi-goreng. We all slept very well. The next day gave me a chance to actually 
see what I had covered in the dark in 1990. A beautiful forest, interrupted by 
huge stands of waving tall grass. The trail was only steep in parts, but well 
curved and making excellent use of the mountain’s contours. We made frequent 
resting stops, and waited for those who were going at a slower pace. Nobody had 
trouble of any kind. The weather was good, a bit breezy perhaps, but pleasant 
enough.&nbsp; After doing a series of slow hairpins, we came to a heavily grown 
ridge, which kept rising mildly and led to the promontory where we would make 
camp. It was tea time, the sun to the west. Through a breach in the crater wall 
that we had used four years ago for our descent to the lake, we could see part 
of the&nbsp; crater . It seemed a lot less green than I remembered and the lake 
seemed different in shape.&nbsp; We speculated about the gas hanging down there, and 
had tea. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">As it turned out, we were not alone. A family of monkeys was 
calling this place home, and they were not shy. We had bought up fresh 
vegetables from the farmers below, and these were going to be part of a 
delicious stew. The monkeys thought differently. We put the bags on a ledge in 
front of the tents, and went about our preparations for the night and the next 
morning, while daylight lasted. There was a scream from Karin, who would be 
making the stew. The bag was gone, and about 20M below two monkeys were fighting 
over a carrot. We would be having packaged food again that night.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">Before dinner Ann led a yoga session as she had done the day 
before. Most of us participated, using our camping mattrasses as a base.&nbsp; Dinner 
tasted good, we felt fit and at ease at the 2800M altitude. The next morning we 
would go up to the rim, and then I would break my promise to the police, taking 
with me whomever wanted to join me in going to the summit, to fulfill the more 
important promise I had made four years earlier.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">It had been breezy throughout the day, but overnight the wind had 
picked up. When we rose at day break, eight of us set out along the trail to the 
ridge. I recognized certain passages where there were fixed ropes and ladders on 
a steep stretch. Then suddenly, we were at the rim, and had a first real peek 
into the crater right below us. The sight was astonishing. What had been green 
-- the stands of pine, the shrubs, the tall grass that covered the gentler 
inside slopes of the enormous crater -- was all gone; covered by a blanket of&nbsp; 
black-gray volcanic material. A sight of death and devastation. A new cone had 
formed where the eruptions had occurred, a small mountain within the mountain: 
“Anak Gunung Rinjani”, as one of the porters called it, “Child of Rinjani.”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">As we carefully made our trail up along the ridge toward the 
summit, the view soon became blurred. The whole ridge was covered with at least 
ten centimeters of fine black ash, that made us feel like we were walking on a 
soft carpet. The ash, however, was so light and fine that it was blown by the 
now fierce wind into ominous clouds. It became hard to breathe, and like 
cowboys, we covered our nose and mouth with a handkerchief. The wind became 
stronger still, and was howling. At least it came from the north, the sea, so I 
figured there was no danger of it carrying poisonous gas. But that meant it blew 
into the direction of the crater’s abyss. We had a brief discussion, and five of 
our group decided to return. Marc and Ronald went on with me, at their own risk. 
After a while Marc decided it was his time to turn around. I went on alone, 
there was no sight of Ronald. The wind became so strong that I had to crawl up 
on all fours, lest I be swept off the ridge. I had visions of my climb of the 
Bernina over the Biancograt in 1987, when my guide shouted to me through the 
howling storm: “es ist jetzt ausserordentlich gefaehrlich,” and short-roped me 
up that knife-edged ridge, both of us crawling like tigers. But my resolve was 
clear: I was going for the summit even if I’d have to crawl all day. </font>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">I passed the spot with the boulder where I had collapsed fours 
year before, and I knew that now I was within striking range. There was no 
turning back. I crawled on over the ash-covered ridge, talking to myself to 
drown my fear of being blown off, and to urge myself on. I must have crawled for 
hours when I came to a strange rock formation blocking my path. There was no 
more ridge behind it, so it seemed. Was this the summit? A look at my altitude 
meter confirmed that I had crossed the 3700M level. I sat down in a hollow 
formed by the rock that sheltered me from the wind. Then, to my great relief, 
the wind abated, and the swirls of black cloud were only below me: I appeared to 
be above the storm, like a plane flying above the clouds. I scanned my 
surroundings, and found that the ridge which had been going east now bent to the 
south. It descended, but was it rising after the first dip? I had heard that 
there was a cairn marking the summit. I decided to explore the ridge south. It 
proved to be the right decision. Twenty minutes later I stood on top of Mount 
Rinjani. The wind was light, the sky bright, the view magnificent. I took my 
telescopic pole out of my pack. It had been of little use during my long crawl, 
but now I needed it as identification for my summit picture. I planted the pole 
into the stones of the cairn, and then wrote the words “Oom Ben” in the smooth 
bed of ash in front of it. The photo I took came out well. One day I will scan 
it into this story-text.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">Before I turned around to go back to my shelter at the rock for 
some food and drink, I noticed&nbsp; something sticking out of the ash on the other 
side of the cairn. Something skin-like. I probed with my pole and to my 
astonishment I dug up the mummified remains of a monkey; I took a picture of it. 
It must have had its own reasons for pursuing the ridge to its apex, which 
turned out to be a point of no return. How long had it been there? I felt some 
sympathy for its surviving relatives who were probably still feasting on our 
vegetables. </font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
<font size="3">As I enjoyed my brunch and the landscape from my high perch, two 
tiny figures appeared out of the still dark swirls below. Twenty minutes later 
Ronald, and a German named Richard whom we had encountered the previous day, 
were standing in front of me. We all went to the summit for a new photo session, 
this time resulting in shots of live bodies.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">We enjoyed another night on the mountain, in a lower camp, did 
yoga and ate and slept well. I bribed the boss of our porters to keep our summit 
drive secret. It must have worked for we reached Mataram without incident. We 
spent the last night together at Senggigi beach, with showers, pool and sea to 
refresh us, and a feast of delicacies, beer and wine to celebrate our success

<font size="3">A few days later, back in Jakarta, I called Ilham to tell him 
that this time I had made it to the summit. Ilham and I had done quite a few 
climbs together in the intermittent four years. Our first climb had been in 
October 1989, to the highest volcano of all, Gunung Kerinci, in central west 
Sumatra. That had been my very first trip with the Java Lavas, and a tall 
Dutchman named Ben Blijleven had led it. Ben enjoyed great respect and 
popularity among the members of the Java Lavas, as well as in that circle of men

<font size="3">I had barely uttered a word on the phone when Ilham interrupted 
me. “Did you hear Oom Ben died?” It hit me like a bolt of lightning. Was this 
one of those famous deja-vu experiences? Was this real? But there it was. During 
the long weekend of our Rinjani climb, our friend, fellow climber and hasher (Oom) 
Ben Blijleven had died of a heart attack after a squash game in Rotterdam. He 
had been a helicopter pilot for Schreiner and had worked in many countries. He 
was repatriated from Indonesia in 1992. Of all places he had been to, he loved 
that country most. His ashes were later to be scattered over Gunung Gede and the 
Java Sea.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">There are people, among them the famous Swiss 
philosopher/psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung, who say that a coincidence often is 
more than meets the eye. They speak of synchronicity, or meaningful coincidence. 
Looking back after so many years on these events, and remembering how much Oom 
Ben Deiters, like my own father, encouraged my first steps in mountaineering; 
and how much Oom Ben Blijleven loved hiking the volcanoes of Indonesia, I can 
only say that Jung makes more sense to me now. And may both Ooms Ben rest in 
peace.</font></span></p>
